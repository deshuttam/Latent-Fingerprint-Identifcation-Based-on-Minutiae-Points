# Latent Fingerprint Identifcation System Based on a Local Combination of Minutiae Feature Points

By Uttam U. Deshpande et al.,

On the basis of the existing partial minutiae characteristics, we have developed Latent Fingerprint Identifcation System. We propose a scale and rotation invariant algorithm called “Ratio of Minutiae Triangles (RMT)”. The algorithm  utilizes the features which are based on the local minutiae arrangements around a reference minutia. To deal with missing minutiae in latent fngerprints, minutiae clusters based on nearest minutiae neighborhood relation to form hash structures.
