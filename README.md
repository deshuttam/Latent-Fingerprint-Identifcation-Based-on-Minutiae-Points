# Latent Fingerprint Identifcation System Based on a Local Combination of Minutiae Feature Points

By Uttam U. Deshpande et al.,

On the basis of the existing partial minutiae characteristics, we have developed Latent Fingerprint Identifcation System. We propose a scale and rotation invariant algorithm called “Ratio of Minutiae Triangles (RMT)”. The algorithm  utilizes the features which are based on the local minutiae arrangements around a reference minutia. To deal with missing minutiae in latent fngerprints, minutiae clusters based on nearest minutiae neighborhood relation to form hash structures.

## Introduction
We have developed a system that identifes a person with an existing small number of minutia features and without requiring fngerprint pre-alignment. A nearest minutiae neighbourhood-based latent fngerprint identifcation algorithm called “Ratio of Minutiae Triangles (RMT)” is proposed to solve fngerprint deformation, rotation, scale, and fingerprint alignment problems.
